# Formal Methods

## Feature development for Act
#### Prior Work
- [Formal Verification Blog](https://fv.ethereum.org/)
- [Ethereum Act](https://github.com/ethereum/act)

#### Description
Act is an effort by several groups working on formal methods for Ethereum smart contracts. It aims to create a simple but effective language to write formal specifications.

This project would involve working on different features of the Act project for the duration of CDAP - there are many open issues of varying difficult ranging from implementing lower-priority proof backends, to improving testing and error handling, to improving the existing data types.


#### Motivation
The beta version of Act has recently been released, and there are many open issues on the repository that are ready to be worked on. It looks like there is a small team looking after this project, and they have written on the repo that contributions on open issues are welcomed. I think this is an important effort that probably doesn't get as much attention as the protocol development, and hope that good contributions would help the team out.

# PoS Consensus

**What is the beacon chain?**

The beacon chain is a new PoS blockchain - also known as the consensus layer - that will help Ethereum transition to a proof of stake consensus mechanism. When the stages are complete, there will exist a number of different components that make up the new architecture (PoS chain, old PoW chain, sharding chain, execution layer).

**How will mining work on the beacon chain?**

Miners will be replaced by validators and beacon nodes. Validators will need to "stake" 32 ETH into a contract on the PoW chain. A validator has to meet certain availability requirements, or they will be penalised.

**What is Altair?**

Altair is a mainnet release scheduled for October 27th of this year intended to make some upgrades to the beacon chain - mostly around bringing staking penalties in line with the eventual plan for Ethereum 2.0. It is also perceived as a practice run of upgrading the beacon chain before the merge.

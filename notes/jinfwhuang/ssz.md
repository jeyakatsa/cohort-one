## My notes
- Define SSZ type: basic and compound types
- Simple serialization and deserialization for SSZ types
- Able to only deserialize specific part of a deep structure
- Merkle proof is easy to express
- Generalized index
  - A serialized object in bytes <--> Seq[byte32] (generalized index)
  - An object path  <--> a generalized index + byte position

### Ethereum Basics

As part of my initial [development update](https://hackmd.io/@dtb/Sk0Q0GW4K), I mentioned a few notes that I took while re-learning the basics of Ethereum -- these are being re-posted here for general visibility purposes:

- [Ethereum Yellow Paper](https://hill-sunfish-15b.notion.site/Ethereum-Yellow-Paper-39d251e4d29b4c29b1d6570dfaa0cd3a) (although, outdated aspects in the current version)
- [EVM Illustrated](https://hill-sunfish-15b.notion.site/EVM-Illustrated-b335445fd30e47c680839f80970b379e) & [Understanding the Ethereum Protocol](https://hill-sunfish-15b.notion.site/Understanding-the-Ethereum-Protocol-54aec00e555740e8a91c5a78e2793ade) (both are very introductory)
- [Exploring Elliptic Curve Pairings](https://hill-sunfish-15b.notion.site/Exploring-Elliptic-Curve-Pairings-3a1bde1155384162af8012840e79350a) (prerequisite for many topics, e.g., zk, Kate commits, etc.)

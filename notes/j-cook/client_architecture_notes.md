# json-rpc

user interacts with the client via the json-rpc
networking allows the information stored in the client to be transferred to other nodes, and to receive data


## how much of this does a light client persist?
full json-rpc
synchroniser
transaction pool
no storage except for a small cache
no consensus
partial implementation of the networking layer - receives blocks, validates them, send transactions
includes minimal subset of the current world state.

does a light client add transactions to the mempool or does it delegate that to a full node?

A full node only includes the current world state and does not do consensus
An archive node has the full historical world state
A mining node has all the above plus participates in consensus and create new blocks
